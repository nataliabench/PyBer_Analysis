# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
PyBer is a ride-sharing company who is conducting a market analysis to better understand their consumer behavior and economic trends.  By eveluating ridesharing data in three city types (urban, surbaban, and rural) and  the number of riders and drivers by city type, we can determine the impact it has on fares.  We will analyze the data by creating visualizations portaying the consumer behavior differences by city type.  PyBer can only continue to grow as a company if they listen to their consumers and interpret their data to improve the services for riders and drivers alike.

## Results
We created a bubble chart on the PyBer ridesharing data that gave a very clear indication on where more drivers were located per city.  The larger the bubble, the more drivers there were per city.  As you can see below, the most PyBer drivers were using the services in urban cities.

To determine the amount of rides by city type, we created a box and whisker plot.  This chart showed that rural cities had an average number of rides approximately four times lower than urban cities and about three and a half times lower than surburban cities.  In conclusion, urban cities have the largest percentages of 68.4% of total rides.  Suburban cities have 26.3% of total rides and lastly, rural cities contain about 5.3% of total rides.  Later, we develoepd a pie chart showing these percentages which was much quicker and easier to intepret.

As for amount of drivers per city type, the number of urban drives is about nine times higher than the number of drivers in rural cities.  The number of suburban drivers is four times higher than the number of rural drivers.  We utilized a box and whisker plot and pie chart to convey these conclusions.
## Summary
Three business recommendations that could be provided to the CEO are:
1.  Diving deeper into the analysis by yearly, montly, or even weekly data if necessary.  Instead of just focusing on one part of the year to determine these conclusions, we can get more efficient results and inferences.  
2.  Analyzing demographic characteristics of riders and drivers.  
3.  Offering benefits to drivers who live in cities with low percentages of drivers and rides.
